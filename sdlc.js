// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisofRequirements ="determine what the application is supposed to do and its requirements including defining the resources needed to build the project "
const design ="A design approach clearly defines all the architectural modules of the product along with its communication and data flow representation with the external and third party modules (if any). The internal design of all the modules of the proposed architecture should be clearly defined with the minutest of the details in DDS."
const implementation= "Starts once the developer gets the Design document. The Software design is translated into source code. All the components of the software are implemented in this phase."
const testingIntegration= "where product defects are reported, tracked, fixed and retested, until the product reaches quality outlined in previous stages"
const Maintain= "if any issue comes up and needs to be fixed or any enhancement is to be done is taken care by the developers."
